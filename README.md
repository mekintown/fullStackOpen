# fullStackOpen

This repository is dedicated to the exercise submissions for the Full Stack Open course offered by the University of Helsinki. This comprehensive course introduces the modern JavaScript-based web development concepts which include React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript. It also encompasses the fundamentals of full stack open-source JavaScript applications development.

The exercises within this repository span the various aspects of full-stack development, from frontend to backend. Each directory within the repository corresponds to a specific part of the course, with further sub-directories for each individual exercise set.

These exercises are not just a way to practice coding, but they also provide an opportunity to understand and implement best coding practices, design principles, and software engineering methods. As such, this repository serves as both a learning tool and a demonstration of acquired skills.

Throughout the repository, there is an emphasis on developing robust, production-grade applications, and a focus on the modern libraries and tools used in the current JavaScript ecosystem. This repository also encourages test-driven development and includes test files for each exercise to ensure code quality and correctness.

All code submissions are rigorously reviewed, ensuring they follow the guidelines provided in the course material, and are optimal, maintainable, and follow modern best practices. Proper error handling, security and performance considerations are also taken into account.

This repository is a testament to the journey of learning full stack development under the guidance of the esteemed University of Helsinki and serves as a portfolio for showcasing my understanding and application of these concepts.

It's an exciting journey. Enjoy browsing through the exercises!
